# Reactive Base Control for On-The-Move Mobile Manipulation in Dynamic Environments

We present a reactive base control method that enables high performance mobile manipulation on-the-move in environments with static and dynamic obstacles. We demonstrate the systems performane in numerous real-world and simulated environments where other robots in the workspace present dynamic obstacles.
